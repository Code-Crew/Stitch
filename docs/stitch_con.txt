Hello eku here,

First I'd like to say that Stitch is not my creation. In fact the only thing I've
done is start it again.

Stitch was originally created by nathanlopez on January 5th 2017. Since then Stitch
had 18 commits pushed to it and has not been updated, edited, assuming looked at,
or anything. Well I like this idea, and I think it's pretty fucking sweet. So I want
to continue the development. Stitch continuation will be moved to
https://github.com/ekultek/Stitch.git if you would like more updates, more edits,
quicker responses for it, and so forth, go there. To see the original Stitch,
go here https://github.com/nathanlopez/Stitch.

Thanks guys.
 - Eku.
